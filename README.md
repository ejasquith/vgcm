The aim of this project is to provide a simple application for a video game collector to manage their collection.  

# Planning Stage

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to add games to my collection
- As a user, I want to remove games from my collection
- As a user, I want to view my collection
- As a user, I want to search, sort, and filter my collection
